---

## üõ† Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sanish1246/driving-school-booking-system.git
```

### 2. Installation

Before proceeding, make sure you have the following NuGuet Packages:

Use the **CLI** and run the following commands:

``` bash 
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore --version 9.0.2
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design --version 9.0.2
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer --version 9.0.2
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools --version 9.0.2
dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration --version 9.0.2
dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json --version 9.0.2
dotnet add package CsvHelper --version 33.0.1
```

**Delete Migrations folder**

**Open context folder, go into DrivingLessonBookingSystem.cs and comment out the following line of codes:**

``` c#
// line 15

// private readonly StreamWriter _logStream = new StreamWriter(new FileStream(
    //     GetPath(),
    //     FileMode.Append,
    //     FileAccess.Write,
    //     FileShare.ReadWrite
    // ));

// line 31

// .ConfigureWarnings(
        //     b => b.Log(
        //         (RelationalEventId.ConnectionOpened, LogLevel.Information),
        //         (RelationalEventId.ConnectionClosed, LogLevel.Information)))
        // .LogTo(_logStream.WriteLine, LogLevel.Information, DbContextLoggerOptions.DefaultWithLocalTime | DbContextLoggerOptions.SingleLine);

```

**NOTE: Add a semi-colon (;) before line 26, at the end of the code else, you will have that red squiggly line**

```
//line 45

// public override void Dispose()
    // {
    //     base.Dispose();
    //     _logStream.Dispose();
    // }

//line 51

// private static string GetPath()
    // {
    //     var workingDirectory = Environment.CurrentDirectory;
    //     var projectDirectory = Directory.GetParent(workingDirectory).Parent.Parent.FullName;
    //     return(Path.Combine(projectDirectory, "Logs","logs.txt"));
    // }
```

**Run the following commands to create the database using code-first approach:**

**NOTE: VERY IMPORTANRT !! Before running the following code, make sure you change the connection string in the configuration settings (appsettings.json file).**

```
"DefaultConnection": "Server=LAPTOP-ILUK0PDF;Database=Driving Booking lesson system;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
```

 Server value (LAPTOP-ILUK0PDF) should be changed to the one your machine uses, as shown in the following picture:


![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ebb7dae-f7f1-43df-a5b3-71aa4802ebb8)

Then proceed with the following steps:

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate -p MainProject

dotnet ef database update -p MainProject

```

**Verify if the database has been created using MSSQL or any other UI**

**Uncomment the code in step 3 (don't forget to remove the semi-colon added or you can just undo everythings in that file)**


## üß™ Using the Program

Once the program is started, users can log in as one of the following roles:

1. **Student** ‚Äì Can book lessons and view their upcoming sessions.  
2. **Instructor** ‚Äì Can view lessons assigned to them.  
3. **Admin** ‚Äì Has full control (CRUD operations) over students, instructors, cars, and lessons.

---

## Users and Their Roles

### üë®‚Äçüéì Students

Students are the primary users of the system who want to learn driving. After logging in, students can:

- **Book lessons** by choosing:
  - A date and time
  - An available **instructor**
  - An available **car**
- **View** upcoming scheduled lessons
- **Update** their profile information if needed

The booking system ensures:
- The selected instructor and car are not double-booked.
- The date is valid and in the future.

This process simulates how a real-world driving school manages bookings for driving sessions.

---

### üë®‚Äçüè´ Instructors

Instructors are responsible for conducting the driving lessons. Once logged in, instructors can:

- **View their assigned lessons**, including:
  - Student name
  - Date and time
  - Assigned vehicle

Instructors do not book or modify lessons themselves. They only have access to their lesson schedule to stay informed about upcoming sessions.

---

This system ensures smooth coordination between students, instructors, and the driving school‚Äôs fleet of cars ‚Äî providing a structured and efficient learning experience.

### Admin Features

Admins have full control over the management of students, instructors, vehicles, and lessons.

#### Add Student Form

One key feature is the **Add Student** interface, which allows Admins to register new students into the system.

### Input Validation

When adding a student, the system performs real-time validation on all fields to ensure data integrity:

- **First Name / Last Name**  
  Must not be empty and should not contain invalid characters.

- **Email**  
  Must be a valid email address format.

- **Password**  
  Must be at least **12 characters** and include:  
  - At least **one uppercase** letter  
  - At least **one lowercase** letter  
  - At least **one digit**  
  - At least **one special character**

- **Phone Number**  
  Must be a valid phone number (digits only and correct length).

- **Date of Birth (DOB)**  
  Must be selected using the date picker control.

- **Address**  
  This is a required field and must not be empty.

If any of the fields are invalid, an appropriate error message is shown in red underneath the corresponding field, guiding the admin to correct it before submitting.

---

### Admin CRUD Functionality

In addition to adding students, the Admin has the ability to:

- **View** all registered students, instructors, cars, and lessons.
- **Edit** any details related to students, instructors, cars, or lessons.
- **Delete** students, instructors, cars, or lessons from the system if needed.

These features provide full administrative control to maintain a clean and up-to-date booking system database.

---

This form and related functionality are part of the Windows Forms (WinForms) application included in the `MainProject` folder.

## üìÅ Project Structure Note

There are **two project folders** in this repository:

- One folder contains the **GUI version** of the application, built with **Windows Forms (WinForms)**.  
- The other folder is a **Console Application**, used for **unit testing**.

### ‚ùì Why Two Projects?

This separation exists because one of the contributors was working on a **Mac**, and **WinForms is not supported on macOS**.

As a workaround, they created a **console-based project** to:

- Reuse the same core logic  
- Handle input/output via terminal  
- Apply **MSTest** effectively for unit testing

This structure improves **testability** and ensures **cross-platform compatibility** for all contributors.
